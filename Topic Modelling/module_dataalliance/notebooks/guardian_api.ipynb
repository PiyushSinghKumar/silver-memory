But Australia is just one of many countries that appear to be caught in a series of rolling Covid waves.</p> \\n<p>There are currently more than 207 people in hospital for every million Australians. Belgium, France, Spain and the United Kingdom all have similar numbers, and many other countries are seeing increasing hospitalisations. Most of the OECD appears to be either coming off a recent wave or in the midst of one. And only a few of them are currently in winter.</p> \\n<p>There are many reasons why Covid is spreading more “successfully”, according to Professor Maximilian de Courten, director of the Mitchell Institute at Victoria University. These include the virus mutating to spread better, the timing of vaccination drives, alongside fatigue among the public, politicians and media for preventative measures such as wearing face masks.</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/01/covid-world-map-which-countries-have-the-most-coronavirus-vaccinations-cases-and-deaths\">Covid world map: which countries have the most coronavirus vaccinations, cases and deaths?</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>For most of the pandemic, Australia had far fewer hospitalisations and deaths than comparable countries. Some OECD countries have seen double or even triple the number of hospitalisations per million as Australia’s peak. Until the Delta wave in late 2021, Australia was one of few countries with fewer deaths throughout the pandemic than would be expected based on previous trends, known as “<a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/articles/measuring-australias-excess-mortality-during-covid-19-pandemic\">excess deaths</a>”.</p> \\n<p>New Zealand is now the only country in the OECD with negative excess deaths, according to a model created by <a href=\"https://github.com/TheEconomist/covid-19-the-economist-global-excess-deaths-model\">the Economist</a>. Based on current trends that might not last long.</p> \\n<p>Australia has now seen over 15,000 excess deaths over the course of the pandemic, according to the model, and the trend is going up. The vast majority of Covid deaths in Australia have been this year.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \\n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2022/07/Oz-covid-international-comparison/mini_multi\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \\n  <div>\\n   default\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Comparing data across countries and even time can be problematic as policies and definitions aren’t uniform. Queensland, for instance, previously had a policy of admitting all positive coronavirus cases to hospital. De Courten says hospitalisations are a far more reliable indicator than case numbers. They are also more pertinent to policymaking.</p> \\n<p>“What should drive decisions is how long the health service can cope with the load.”</p> \\n<p>At over 5,300 people currently in hospitals with Covid, De Courten says the Australian health system is “being overrun”. Data from Our World in Data shows hospitalisations in much of the OECD is trending upwards, including in Australia.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v19/index.html?key=oz-datablogs-covid-international-comparison-sm-deaths-hospitalisatinos&amp;location=yacht-charter-data\" data-alt=\"Hospitalisations are increasing in many countries\"> \\n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v19/index.html?key=oz-datablogs-covid-international-comparison-sm-deaths-hospitalisatinos&amp;location=yacht-charter-data\">Interactive</a> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Even with huge numbers of infections, Australia still isn’t seeing the levels of hospitalisations and deaths many comparable countries had earlier in the pandemic.</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/20/ama-chief-says-its-time-for-mask-mandates-again-amid-pretty-scary-covid-hospital-numbers\">AMA chief says mask mandates becoming more likely amid ‘pretty scary’ Covid hospital numbers</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>The United Kingdom got up to 583 hospitalisations per million in January 2021, the United States saw highs of 458, Poland 910 and Hungary over 1,200.

Clive Palmer’s United Australia Party had a 0.7% towards them. That compares to the Greens which gained 1.5% more first preferences, while the major parties suffered a combined swing against them of just over 6%.

The United Australia Party improved its position in two-thirds of the seats it ran in. </p> \\n<p>Dr Josh Roose, senior research fellow at Deakin University, told Guardian Australia that the anti-vaccination population was quite small, but when viewed as part of a broader sense of disaffection with politics and the main parties, there was a worrying trend.</p> \\n<p>“It would be a mistake to view the anti-vax stuff as a determinant factor in the vote,” Roose said.</p> \\n<p>“But flipping it on its head, the United Australian party has managed to increase its vote by a significant percentage over its last outcome. It might not have a seat this time but if it continues this pattern it might [in future parliaments] have several.”</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2022/superyacht/alpha/index.html?key=oz-datablogs-election-anti-vax-swings&amp;location=yacht-charter-data\" data-alt=\"National first preference swings by party/affiliation\"> \\n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2022/superyacht/alpha/index.html?key=oz-datablogs-election-anti-vax-swings&amp;location=yacht-charter-data\">Interactive</a> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Less than 10% of Australians were either not willing to have a Covid vaccine or were not sure, according to the Melbourne Institute’s <a href=\"https://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/publications/research-insights/ttpn/vaccination-report\">vaccine hesitancy tracker</a> in December. This figure had dropped from a high of more than 30% in April 2021.</p> \\n<p>Roose said the anti-Covid vaccination movement was part of the larger protests against Covid measures such as lockdowns.</p> \\n<p>“Really it was only ever a couple of hundred people that was showing up at these [anti-vaccination protests], in the early days. As the lockdowns took hold, people started losing their jobs, and people … were frustrated and angry and we saw an increase in the size of those protests,” Roose said.</p> \\n<p>“The largest protests in Melbourne were made up of a lot of workers who had lost jobs or who were being told they had to be vaccinated. That was back in September. But for the most part the anti-vax movement has only ever been a really small percentage of the community.”</p> \\n<p>Many political parties and candidates sought to leverage this movement. UAP leader Craig Kelly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/08/craig-kelly-billed-taxpayers-to-fly-to-melbourne-anti-lockdown-rallies\">joined anti-mandate protests</a>, for instance. One Nation, the Liberal Democrats, UAP, Great Australia party and the Informed Medical Options party adopted explicit policies against vaccine mandates.</p> \\n<p>One Nation and UAP received a combined 9% of first preference votes. But a significant part of the swing to these parties is likely because they ran more candidates. One Nation ran 149 candidates in the 2022 election compared to just 59 in 2019. The Liberal Democrats ran in 100 seats in 2022 and just 10 in 2019.</p> \\n<p>The Great Australia and Informed Medical Options parties also ran more candidates in 2022 than 2019. The United Australia party, which ran 151 candidates in both elections, saw a 0.7% swing towards it.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \\n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2022/06/oz-election-anti-vaccine-mandate-lollipops/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \\n  <div>\\n   default\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<p>We can see that One Nation saw swings against it in almost twice as many seats as they gained ground. The Liberal Democrats saw a split result – losing ground in half the seats they contested this time around. Only the United Australia party gained ground in more seats than it lost votes.</p> \\n<p>The results were also mixed for candidates of major parties who expressed anti-vaccine mandate sentiment. Nationals MP for Mallee, <a href=\"https://www.annewebster.com.au/inthenews/interview-with-jase-at-river-1467/\">Anne Webster</a>, launched a petition against Victoria’s vaccine requirements in October and there was a 22% swing towards her on first preferences, although she did not face a Liberal party challenger this election as she did in 2019. Liberal MP Russell Broadbent (who <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-02-14/liberal-mp-promotes-taking-ivermectin-for-covid-19/100828744\">refused to be vaccinated</a>) and Coalition candidate Simon Kennedy (who <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-04-26/bennelong-liberal-candidate-voices-vaccine-concerns/101016110\">appeared at an anti-vaccination meeting</a>) both suffered greater swings against them than the Coalition overall.</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2022/may/28/votes-for-labor-and-the-coalition-plummet-to-all-time-low-as-australia-swings-away-from-major-parties\">Votes for Labor and the Coalition plummet to all-time low as Australia swings away from major parties</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>This is not to say the candidates’ views on vaccine mandates were the determining factor in these results, as there were many other factors at play during the election.</p> \\n<p>Guardian Australia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2022/may/28/votes-for-labor-and-the-coalition-plummet-to-all-time-low-as-australia-swings-away-from-major-parties\">has previously found</a> little association between Coalition swings and vaccination rates across electorates. We repeated this analysis and found only a slight association for the United Australia party. The effect for One Nation and the Liberal Democrats was even more negligible, and Informed Medical Consent only ran in one lower house seat in 2019 and 2022.</p> \\n<p>While opposition to vaccination mandates does not appear to have influenced the election, Roose said more attention was needed on the disaffection and the myriad ways it manifests. This includes the “pro-freedom” movement, political issues imported from the United States, and conspiratorial thinking around things such as the World Health Organization and a secret New World Order.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v20/index.html?key=oz-datablogs-election-primary-vote-majors-greens&amp;location=yacht-charter-data\" data-alt=\"First preference vote over time\"> \\n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v20/index.html?key=oz-datablogs-election-primary-vote-majors-greens&amp;location=yacht-charter-data\">Interactive</a> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Roose also noted that many “fringe” parties have been successful at speaking about economic disaffection, noting UAP’s policies around interest rates and housing.</p> \\n<p>“I see the fringe movements – that 10% of the population, and in some areas it was a lot higher – turning to extreme ideas.</p> \\n<p>“We’ve got to look at the trend over the long term. We’ve got elections every three years. In a decade’s time it’s possible to have three elections, and maybe even more. In three elections time what is it showing us?

It is the highest annual tally of antisemitic hatred CST has ever recorded and is a 34% increase from the 1,684 incidents recorded in 2020.</p> <p>The biggest surge coincided with the bloody conflict in the Middle East in May. Incidents involving schools, pupils and teachers hit a new high, more than tripling the number in 2020. There was a similar rise in incidents among students and academics, with the highest volume of university-related hate ever recorded – and half of it happening in May 2021.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2022-02-09-12:27:12/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2022-02-09-12:27:12/embed.html\">Chart</a> </figure>  <p>Jewish people in Manchester and London endured 155 antisemitic incidents involving people shouting abuse from passing vehicles, more than half of which happened in May and June. Hundreds of Palestinians and 13 people in Israel were killed as Israel carried out airstrikes in Gaza and Hamas fired rockets into Israel.</p> <p>More than a third of all the UK incidents involved language, imagery or behaviour that referenced the conflict in the Middle East or demonstrated anti-Zionist motivation alongside antisemitism.</p> <p>The home secretary, Priti Patel, described the figures as “shocking”, while the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said the new record was “truly appalling”. The government’s independent adviser on antisemitism, the peer John Mann, said it was time to “reconsider our efforts to tackle antisemitism”.</p> <p>“These record levels of anti-Jewish racism, reported by our Jewish community to CST and police, show how difficult last year was for Jews across Britain,” said Mark Gardner, the chief executive of CST, which also provides security for Jewish people and properties.</p> <p>“These hatreds boil away, taking any excuse to publicly burst out against Jews. This is exactly what happened during and after the Israel-Gaza war of May 2021, from schools and universities, through to the carloads of people who repeatedly drove to Jewish areas and yelled vile abuse at anyone who looked Jewish.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2022-02-09-12:25:52/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2022-02-09-12:25:52/embed.html\">Chart</a> </figure>  <p>The report provides images of antisemitic graffiti in Tower Hamlets about “Zionist military police” and “mind control”, a candelabra to celebrate the festival of Hanukah smashed to the ground in Camden and graffiti on a pavement in Gateshead that read “Fuck Jews”.</p> <p>There was a decrease in online hate overall, possibly because of a fall in the number of incidents related to the Labour party. CST said it previously recorded surges in online antisemitic vitriol from people who felt allegations of antisemitism in the party were manufactured by the wider Jewish community to smear the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>There was also evidence of Covid-related antisemitism with leaflets distributed to homes in South Yorkshire saying “Don’t trust the Jew jab” and other similar slurs. A total of 78 incidents were related to the pandemic – from conspiracy theories about Jewish involvement in creating and spreading Covid-19 or the “myth” of Covid-19, to wishing that Jewish people caught the virus and died from it. Some reports related to the misappropriation of Holocaust imagery such as the yellow Star of David as part of anti-lockdown or anti-vaccine campaigns.</p> <p>Racists also found a new way to spread their hate. There were 16 reports of “Zoombombings” – video conferencing events being hijacked with antisemitic material during 2021.</p> <p>The conflict in the Middle East coincided with the easing of Covid-19 restrictions in the UK, which CST said may have fuelled the spike in hate incidents. In May businesses were allowed to reopen, most legal controls on outdoor socialising were lifted and two households were able to meet indoors.</p> <p>“It is possible that the relaxing of regulations, coinciding with a trigger event as emotive as renewed war between Israel and Hamas, provided the opportunity and impetus for a mass release of lockdown-induced frustrations,” the report said. “These factors may have played a part in the extent of the rise in antisemitic incident reports during and in the aftermath of this period.”</p> <p>Patel said: “Our Jewish community has been subject to appalling hatred … In addition to supporting the work of CST, I continue to support the police to ensure they have the resources to tackle these despicable incidents so that perpetrators can then be punished with the full force of the law.”</p> <p>Cooper said the increasing number of incidents “shows just how far we have to go to remove the stain of antisemitism from our society”.</p> <p>“We need urgent action to tackle these vile incidents wherever they arise, be it in schools, on our streets or online,” she said. “Hatred is unacceptable in all its forms, and it is our responsibility to stamp it out once and for all.”</p>', 'shortUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/p/kjf74'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'news/2022/feb/18/corrections-and-clarifications', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'news', 'sectionName': 'News', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-02-18T21:00:15Z', 'webTitle': 'Corrections and clarifications', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/18/corrections-and-clarifications', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2022/feb/18/corrections-and-clarifications', 'fields': {'body': '<p>• In an article about the film Belfast, one interviewee, Moore Armstrong, was misnamed as Moore Kennedy (<a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/film/2022/feb/11/i-just-cried-film-stirs-memories-on-belfast-street-branagh-left-behind\" title=\"\">‘I just cried’: Belfast stirs up buried memories</a>, 12 February, p17).</p> <p>• A book review incorrectly described Michael Ignatieff as a “Booker prize-winning novelist”.

For this chart and the ones following, we’re using the first preferences swing away from any Coalition party candidate in an electorate. This gives us the broadest coverage for electorates as the two-candidate and two-party preferred figures either aren’t yet available or useful for a number of seats.</p> <p>The swing away from the Coalition has not been uniform across the country, with the swing as high as 10% in Western Australia, where the Coalition has lost five seats (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/25/labor-ran-a-hyper-local-campaign-in-western-australia-with-a-separate-strategy-group-and-different-ads\">you can read the inside story of how WA Labor ran their campaign here</a>).</p> <p>The only state with a swing towards the Coalition was in Tasmania, however no seats have changed hands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2022-05-27-02:35:29/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Coalition first preference swing by state\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2022-05-27-02:35:29/embed.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The next chart shows the swing grouped by the remoteness of electorates.</p> <p>The Coalition suffered an average swing against it of 7.5% in inner metropolitan seats.

It just shows the characteristics of electorates that were associated with a swing.</p> <p>This chart shows the relationship between higher education and swing to or from the Coalition.

Each of them has an estimated $5.4bn (£4.1bn) fortune – up a fifth so far this year.</p> <p>They join Cargill’s other great-grandchildren Pauline Keinath and Gwendolyn Sontheim Meyer on the richest 500 list. They each have fortunes of about $8.06bn.</p> <p>Their fortunes track those of the giant Cargill food company, which employs more than 155,000 staff in 70 countries and is expected to report record profits this year, outstripping <a href=\"https://www.cargill.com/page/annual-report-2021\">2021’s record-breaking $5bn</a> profit.</p> <p>The UN this month warned that global food prices had soared to a record high because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en/\">UN’s Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) said</a> its food price index had risen by 12.6% in March compared with February, “making a giant leap to a new highest level since its inception in 1990”.</p> <p>The UN said the war in Ukraine had “spread shocks through markets for staple grains and vegetable oils”. The price of cereals, vegetable oils and meat have reached all-times highs, the FAO said.</p> <p>The war has disrupted Black Sea exports of crucial commodities from a region that had been producing more than a quarter of the world’s wheat exports.</p> <p>The invasion has helped push cereal prices up 17% over the past month, with the closure of ports throttling wheat and maize exports from Ukraine. Russian exports have also been slowed by financial and shipping problems.</p> <p>World wheat prices soared by 19.7% during March, while maize prices posted a 19.1% month-on-month increase, hitting a record high along with those of barley and sorghum.</p> <p>Food prices were already rising before Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in February, and Cargill’s chief executive, David MacLennan, had said he expected them to remain high throughout 2022.</p> <p>Cargill, which has its headquarters in Minnesota, reported a 63% increase in profits last year to almost $4.93bn – the biggest in its 157-year history. Revenues rose by 17% to $134bn.</p> <p>Andrew Speke of the High Pay Centre thinktank, which campaigns for a fairer society, said the soaring wealth of the Cargill family was “a depressing indictment of our current economic model – one which has enabled a tiny minority to grow ever richer despite the longest freeze of living standards in the modern era and a cost of living crisis which is threatening to impoverish millions”.</p> <p>He added: “Now more than ever, it is essential that governments take serious action to redistribute wealth from the super-rich to those on low and middle incomes.”</p> <p>Three more Cargill family members – Alexandra Daitch, Sarah MacMillan and Lucy Stitzer – are also billionaires. The extended family controls about 87% of the company and is ranked as the 11th richest family in the world, with a collective fortune of about $50bn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian\\xa0business\\xa0email sign-up\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eric Muňoz, Oxfam America’s senior policy adviser for agriculture, said: “Right now we’re seeing food prices skyrocket, which is taking a devastating toll on the most vulnerable communities.

The data, which is only a partial capture of the bank’s 1.5 million private banking clients, is linked to more than 30,000 Credit Suisse clients. The leak includes personal, shared and corporate bank accounts – holding, on average, 7.5m Swiss francs (CHF).&nbsp;Almost 200 accounts in the data are&nbsp;worth more than 100m CHF, and more than a dozen&nbsp;are&nbsp;valued in the billions.&nbsp;While some accounts in the data were open as far back as the 1940s, more than two-thirds were opened since 2000. Many of those were still open well into the last decade, and a portion remain open today.</p>\\n    <p>The Guardian was among more than 48 media partners around the world including journalists at Le Monde, NDR, the Miami Herald and the New York Times. They spent months using the data to investigate the bank, in a project coordinated by Süddeutsche Zeitung and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). They unearthed evidence Credit Suisse accounts had been used by clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes, suggesting widespread failures of due diligence by the bank. It is not illegal to have a Swiss account and the leak also contained data of legitimate clients who had done nothing wrong. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/20/credit-suisse-responds-suisse-secrets-disclosures-statement-switzerland\">its response</a>, Credit Suisse said it \"strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices\".</p>\\n    <p></p>\\n   </div>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Yet that pillar of Credit Suisse’s business – cultivating rich clients for a range of banking services – is precisely what has come under the spotlight in the revelations in the Suisse secrets project.</p> \\n<p>A massive leak has revealed that Credit Suisse harboured the hidden wealth of clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes. The revelations point to apparently widespread failures of due diligence by the lender, despite repeated pledges to weed out dubious clients and<strong> </strong>stamp out illicit funds.</p> \\n<p>In response, Credit Suisse said it was unable to comment on specific clients but “strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices”, which it said were “based on partial, selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank’s business conduct”.</p> \\n<p>However, the simultaneous disclosures by 48 media organisations have raised painful questions for the bank. For anyone who has followed the string of scandals in recent years, they will have a familiar ring.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"899966edbe1798e98abc6b6e0719fe723671f123\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/899966edbe1798e98abc6b6e0719fe723671f123/0_74_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Axel Lehmann, the bank’s newly installed chairman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Axel Lehmann, the bank’s newly installed chairman.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Has Credit Suisse had a high tolerance for risky clients? Has it done enough to strengthen internal due diligence controls? Was there a culture in which bankers held their noses and looked the other way when taking or keeping money from dubious clients, particularly public officials who might have been involved in corruption? Did profit take priority over ethics?</p> \\n<p>In its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/19/credit-suisse-responds-suisse-secrets-disclosures-statement-switzerland\">response to the media</a>, the bank says these are historical matters relating to a tiny fraction of its customers. It says it has kept pace with banking regulations across the sector, putting in place a strict zero-tolerance policy towards tax evasion and stringent control measures to counter money laundering.</p> \\n<p>Yet Credit Suisse has spent decades apologising for past horrors, only for more skeletons to emerge from its cupboards.</p> \\n<p>Its newly installed chairman, Axel Lehmann, will be hoping the Suisse secrets leak will be just another public relations crisis for the bank, and there have been no shortage of those. In the past six months, the lender admitted to defrauding investors as part of the historical Mozambique <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/19/credit-suisse-fined-350m-over-mozambique-tuna-bonds-loan-scandal\">“tuna bonds” loan scandal</a> and Lehmann’s immediate predecessor, António Horta-Osório, resigned over Covid regulation breaches.</p> \\n<p>But these disclosures also threaten to throw a spanner in the works of an aggressive restructuring plan that relies on squeezing more money out of its wealth management division.</p> \\n<p>Credit Suisse is one of the largest wealth managers in the world, handling more than 1.6tn Swiss francs (CHF) (£1.3tn) for clients. With plans to divert 3bn CHF-worth (£2.4bn) of resources from the investment bank and towards the wealth management division by 2024, and hire at least 500 relationship managers to find and serve wealthy customers, the overhaul has been viewed by analysts as a sensible response to recent woes involving complex investment products and its services to hedge funds.</p> \\n<p>Part of the bank’s growth strategy will involve courting clients in emerging markets, where there is a greater risk of corruption.</p> \\n<p>Credit Suisse has struggled in recent years to keep bosses in the job long enough to see through significant changes. But if Gottstein and Lehmann are to regain the trust of markets and regulators, they will have to prove their aversion to dubious clients, no matter how lucrative their accounts may be.</p>', 'shortUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/p/ky4y3'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}, {'id': 'news/2022/feb/13/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-release-deal-collapses', 'type': 'article', 'sectionId': 'news', 'sectionName': 'News', 'webPublicationDate': '2022-02-13T07:30:16Z', 'webTitle': 'Zaghari-Ratcliffe ‘angry at her life being stolen’ after deal for release collapses', 'webUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/13/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-release-deal-collapses', 'apiUrl': 'https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2022/feb/13/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-release-deal-collapses', 'fields': {'body': '<p>The husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian charity worker detained in Iran, has said she is “very, very angry” after learning about the collapse of a deal to bring her home.</p> <p>Zaghari-Ratcliffe fears she is a “bargaining chip” in ongoing nuclear talks and is filled with “anger at her life being stolen” and the government’s “lack of urgency” in securing her release, Richard Ratcliffe said.</p> <p>The 43-year-old, from West Hampstead in London, was jailed for five years in 2016 after being convicted on national security charges for plotting to topple the Iranian government, which she has always denied.</p> <p>She was released temporarily in 2020 during the Covid pandemic, but was handed a further sentence in 2021 for “spreading propaganda” and is held under house arrest in Tehran, unable to return to the UK to join her husband and seven-year-old daughter, Gabriella.</p> <p>On Wednesday, MPs were told the UK had signed an agreement to secure her release in the summer, but that the deal had fallen through.

A novelty cheque again made headlines in 2020, when Senator Pauline Hanson announced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/sep/21/labor-wants-pauline-hanson-investigated-over-23m-rockhampton-stadium-novelty-cheque\">$23m grant for Rockhampton stadium</a>.</p> <p>With this in mind, we trained an object recognition model to spot giant cheques. And from there it was a short step further to look at other common tropes of election campaign photo ops: hi-vis workwear and hardhats, cute dogs, and footballs.</p> <p>We chose these as they were either already available in pre-trained models such as <a href=\"https://cocodataset.org/#home\">Coco</a>, or had publicly available image datasets for model training.</p> <p>Then we collated every photo posted by a major party candidate, MP or senator to Facebook in the 2022 and 2019 election periods using the Facebook API, and ran our object detection models on these images.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"203d276062afd0ef020483e630aa124c1727e7ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/203d276062afd0ef020483e630aa124c1727e7ec/0_125_720_432/500.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Albanese speaking to the media at a Toll warehouse\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Safety first: Anthony Albanese speaks to the media at a Toll warehouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So what did we find?</p> <p>First, some important caveats about our method.</p> <p>While many of the images do constitute pictures from photo ops, many photos are also just things politicians shared on their pages. For the prime ministerial candidates, the Facebook photo dataset also doesn’t include every photo op they’ve done on the campaign trail – we were able to cross-check this <a href=\"https://photos.aap.com.au/galleries/Newsroom/ELECTION22\">thanks to AAP’s comprehensive election coverage</a>.</p> <p>So the dataset is not necessarily all the photos the politicians want to go on the news, but definitely the ones they want to share with voters on social media.</p> <p>We also first checked each image for the presence of a person before running the object detection. This excludes photos that only had a dog, for example. Our method also can’t tell if the politician is the one wearing the hi-vis, so if a politician shares a photo of someone else in workwear, it will be counted.</p> <p>These detection methods also don’t have 100% accuracy, so it’s best to treat the following numbers as a minimum count.</p> <p>Here’s the total number of all photos featuring each thing, along with the proportion of all photos in that campaign year:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2022/05/ai2html-output_photo-ops\" data-alt=\"photo ops summary\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2022/05/ai2html-output_photo-ops\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>It suggests that politicians are leaning even more heavily into the hi-vis photo opportunity, and leveraging the broad appeal of the cute dog. Novelty cheques however are relatively scarce in this campaign period, and footballs and other sports balls are down on 2019.</p> <p>Now let’s look only at the photos posted by the leaders of the major parties – the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese. For this one, we checked against their actual Facebook feed for any photos our models had missed.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v21/index.html?key=1ssqJ097UJTTr2Smz2Z3XDM0CdsM6dssjDWs8YE-eQS8&amp;location=docsdata\" data-alt=\"2022 leaders\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v21/index.html?key=1ssqJ097UJTTr2Smz2Z3XDM0CdsM6dssjDWs8YE-eQS8&location=docsdata\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p><br>Both leaders have had a few campaign moments with dogs, so there’s no surprises there.</p> <p>But Morrison has a higher hi-vis count than Albanese, despite Labor being more usually associated with blue-collar workers.</p> <p>It’s possible that Albanese’s missed days on the campaign trail due to Covid-19 account for this. However, could it be that Albanese’s makeover and relative lower hi-vis count – new suits, glasses and so on – is part of a strategy to make the Labor leader more appealing to business leaders? And could it be the reverse for Morrison – is the party of business making a visual appeal to voters outside their traditional base? This is only speculation, but it’s something to consider.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0d97a50e9a65bf3b49d083f895d9a342aaecdc8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0d97a50e9a65bf3b49d083f895d9a342aaecdc8/0_0_720_405/500.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Morrison speaks to staff TEi Services in Townsville, in matching hi-vis.\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott Morrison speaks to staff TEi Services in Townsville, in matching hi-vis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These types of photo opportunities are an inexpensive way to get voters’ attention and communicate a politician’s position on an issue, according to Luke Mansilo, a PhD candidate in political science at the University of Sydney.</p> <p>“‘Dog licks politician’ is a very low-cost way of getting attention, as opposed to paying for advertisements,” he said.</p> <p>“And going to a factory that makes you wear a hi-vis vest does make a really quick, visual short cue for someone who’s not always necessarily paying attention to the news to think, ‘This party is representing the interests of people like me’.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9490ec4222e1d0672bee944c7fc92e5b4f172c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9490ec4222e1d0672bee944c7fc92e5b4f172c0/0_24_720_432/500.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Albanese leveraging the universal love of dogs on the the campaign trail.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Albanese leveraging the universal love of dogs on the the campaign trail.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finally, here are the top 10 politicians ranked by the number of hi-vis and hardhat photos posted during this election campaign:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v21/index.html?key=1FFSgoigx0MST63CjaRXU_3k8Jrufcp6c6JiBnimPH_4&amp;location=docsdata\" data-alt=\"top 10 leaderboard\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v21/index.html?key=1FFSgoigx0MST63CjaRXU_3k8Jrufcp6c6JiBnimPH_4&location=docsdata\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p><br>In the lead is the Liberal candidate for Paterson, Brooke Vitnell, who has posted photos from a number of factory visits in the New South Wales electorate where she’s campaigning.</p> <h2>Notes and methods</h2> <p>Facebook photos for all Labor and Coalition MPs, candidates and senators were scraped for the 2019 and 2022 campaign periods.

The data, which is only a partial capture of the bank’s 1.5 million private banking clients, is linked to more than 30,000 Credit Suisse clients. The leak includes personal, shared and corporate bank accounts – holding, on average, 7.5m Swiss francs (CHF).&nbsp;Almost 200 accounts in the data are&nbsp;worth more than 100m CHF, and more than a dozen&nbsp;are&nbsp;valued in the billions.&nbsp;While some accounts in the data were open as far back as the 1940s, more than two-thirds were opened since 2000. Many of those were still open well into the last decade, and a portion remain open today.</p>\\n    <p>The Guardian was among more than 48 media partners around the world including journalists at Le Monde, NDR, the Miami Herald and the New York Times. They spent months using the data to investigate the bank, in a project coordinated by Süddeutsche Zeitung and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). They unearthed evidence Credit Suisse accounts had been used by clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes, suggesting widespread failures of due diligence by the bank. It is not illegal to have a Swiss account and the leak also contained data of legitimate clients who had done nothing wrong. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/20/credit-suisse-responds-suisse-secrets-disclosures-statement-switzerland\">its response</a>, Credit Suisse said it \"strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices\".</p>\\n    <p></p>\\n   </div>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<p>They include a human trafficker in the Philippines, a Hong Kong stock exchange boss jailed for bribery, a billionaire who ordered the murder of his Lebanese pop star girlfriend and executives who looted Venezuela’s state oil company, as well as corrupt politicians from Egypt to Ukraine.</p> \\n<p>One Vatican-owned account in the data was used to spend €350m (£290m) in an allegedly fraudulent investment in London property that is at the centre of an ongoing criminal trial of several defendants, including a cardinal.</p> \\n<p>The huge trove of banking data was leaked by an anonymous whistleblower to the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. “I believe that Swiss banking secrecy laws are immoral,” the whistleblower source said in a statement. “The pretext of protecting financial privacy is merely a fig leaf covering the shameful role of Swiss banks as collaborators of tax evaders.”</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5e010e99b8d6d78b3de2649c60709b5b58178ff0\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e010e99b8d6d78b3de2649c60709b5b58178ff0/25_7_4975_2985/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Suisse secrets graphic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The revelations may fuel questions over whether Credit Suisse’s challenges over the past few years are indicative of a deep malaise at the bank.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Guardian/David Levene</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Credit Suisse said that Switzerland’s strict banking secrecy laws prevented it from commenting on claims relating to individual clients.</p> \\n<p>“Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices,” the bank said in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/20/credit-suisse-responds-suisse-secrets-disclosures-statement-switzerland\">statement</a>, arguing that the matters uncovered by reporters are based on “selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank’s business conduct.”</p> \\n<p>The bank also said the allegations were largely historical, in some instances dating back to a time when “laws, practices and expectations of financial institutions were very different from where they are now”.</p> \\n<p>While some accounts in the data were open as far back as the 1940s, more than two-thirds were opened since 2000.

Last month, it lost its chairman, António Horta-Osório, after he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/17/antonio-horta-osorio-bankings-go-to-man-felled-by-a-breach-of-covid-rules\">twice broke Covid-19 regulations</a>.</p> \\n<p>That capped an unprecedented year of controversies in which the bank became embroiled in the collapse of the supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital and the US hedge fund Archegos Capital, and was fined £350m over its role in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/19/credit-suisse-fined-350m-over-mozambique-tuna-bonds-loan-scandal\">loan scandal in Mozambique</a>.</p> \\n<p>This month, Credit Suisse became the first major Swiss bank in the country’s history to face criminal charges – which it denies – relating to allegation it helped launder money from the cocaine trade on behalf of the Bulgarian mafia.</p> \\n<p>However, the repercussions of the leak could be much broader than one bank, threatening a crisis for Switzerland, which retains one of the world’s most secretive banking laws. Swiss financial institutions manage about 7.9tn CHF (£6.3tn) in assets, nearly half of which belongs to foreign clients.</p> \\n<p>The Suisse secrets project sheds a rare light on one of the world’s largest financial centres, which has grown used to operating in the shadows. It identifies the convicts and money launderers who were able to open bank accounts, or keep them open for years after their crimes emerged. And it reveals how Switzerland’s famed banking secrecy laws helped facilitate the looting of countries in the developing world.</p> \\n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \\n<h2>Disgraced executives, fraudsters, traffickers – clients</h2> \\n<p>When Ronald Li Fook-shiu approached a banker to open an account in 2000, he is unlikely to have been viewed as a run-of-the-mill client. A former chairman of the Hong Kong stock exchange, he was one of the wealthiest people in the city, where he was known as the “godfather of the stock market”. But he was perhaps better known for the time he spent in a maximum security prison.</p> \\n<p>Li’s career had ended in disgrace in 1990, when he was convicted of taking bribes in exchange for listing companies on the stock exchange. However, a decade later Li was nonetheless able to open an account that later held 59m CHF (£26.3m), according to the leak.</p> \\n<p>He has since died, but his case is one of dozens discovered by reporters appearing to show Credit Suisse opened or maintained accounts for clients who had serious convictions that might be expected to show up in due diligence checks. There are other instances in which Credit Suisse may have taken quick action after red flags emerged, but the case nonetheless shows that dubious clients have been attracted to the bank.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88e09cc5a95cb600b2b43dfd5b97afd08b11d58b\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88e09cc5a95cb600b2b43dfd5b97afd08b11d58b/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ronald Li Fook-shiu\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ronald Li Fook-shiu was known as the ‘godfather of the stock market’.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Guardian/Alamy</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Like every other bank in the world, Credit Suisse professes to have stringent control mechanisms to carry out extensive due diligence on its customers to “ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld”.

Clients would face intensified scrutiny when flagged as a politically exposed person from a high-risk country, or a person involved in a high-risk activity such as gambling, weapons trading, financial services or mining, the report said.</p> \\n<p>Relationship managers were expected to use external sources to verify customers and their risk levels, according to the leak, including news articles or databases such as the <a href=\"https://www.sifma.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Refinitiv-WC_brochure.pdf\">Thomson Reuters World-Check platform</a>, which is used widely in the financial services sector to flag when people are arrested, charged, investigated or convicted of a serious crime.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e3f8a93f3ca629f6876b7683c33c58ca6b7aab21\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3f8a93f3ca629f6876b7683c33c58ca6b7aab21/0_0_3000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rodoljub Radulović\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rodoljub Radulović.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Handout</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Such controls might be expected to prevent a bank from opening accounts for clients such as Rodoljub Radulović, a Serbian securities fraudster indicted in 2001 by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. However, the leaked data identifies him as the co-signatory of two Credit Suisse company accounts. The first was opened in 2005, the year after the SEC had secured a default judgment against Radulović for running a pump-and-dump scheme.</p> \\n<p>One of Radulović’s company accounts held 3.4m CHF (£2.2m) before they closed in 2010. He was recently given a 10-year prison sentence by a court in Belgrade for his role trafficking cocaine from South America for the organised crime boss Darko Šarić. Radulović’s lawyer did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p> \\n<p>Due diligence is not only for new clients. Banks are required to continually reassess existing customers. The 2017 report said Credit Suisse screened customers at least every three years and as often as once a year for the riskiest clients. Lawyers for Credit Suisse told the Guardian these periodic reviews were introduced “more than 15 years ago”, meaning it was continually running due diligence on existing clients from 2007.</p> \\n<p>The bank might, therefore, have been expected to have discovered that its German client Eduard Seidel was convicted of bribery in 2008. Seidel was an employee of Siemens. As the multinational’s lead in Nigeria, he oversaw a campaign of industrial-scale bribery to secure lucrative contracts for his employer by funnelling cash to corrupt Nigerian politicians.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"753dbaa8e62943b3419d83bdf1f646989ac18d3d\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/753dbaa8e62943b3419d83bdf1f646989ac18d3d/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eduard Seidel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eduard Seidel, convicted of bribery in 2008.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Handout</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>After German authorities raided the Munich headquarters of Siemens in 2006, Seidel immediately confessed his role in the bribery scheme, though he said he had never stolen from the company or appropriated its slush funds. His involvement in the corruption led to his name being entered into the Thomson Reuters World-Check database in 2007.</p> \\n<p>However, the leaked Credit Suisse data shows his accounts were left open until at least well into the last decade. At one point after he left Siemens, one account was worth 54m CHF (£24m). Seidel’s lawyer declined to say whether the accounts were his. He said his client had addressed all outstanding matters relating to his bribery offences and wished to move on with his life.</p> \\n<p>The lawyer did not respond to repeated invitations to explain the source of the 54m CHF. Siemens said it did not know about the money and that its review of its own cashflows shed no light on the account.</p> \\n<p>While Credit Suisse said in its statement it could not comment on any specific clients, the bank said “actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed”.</p> \\n<p>In some instances, Credit Suisse is understood to have frozen accounts belonging to problematic clients. Yet questions remain about how quickly the bank moved to close them.</p> \\n<p>One client, Stefan Sederholm, a Swedish computer technician who opened an account with Credit Suisse in 2008, was able to keep it open for two-and-a-half years after his widely reported conviction for human trafficking in the Philippines, for which he was given a life sentence.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da7d91496cadb9f18d5140e79ff5b031b1992d96\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da7d91496cadb9f18d5140e79ff5b031b1992d96/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stefan Sederholm.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stefan Sederholm.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: AFP</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Sederholm’s crime first came to light in 2009, when police in Manila raided a storefront purporting to be the local chapter of the Mindanao Peoples’ Peace Movement, and discovered about 17 women in cubicles with webcams performing sex shows for foreign customers. He was convicted in 2011.</p> \\n<p>A representative for Sederholm said Credit Suisse never froze his accounts and did not close them until 2013 when he was unable to provide due diligence material. Asked why Sederholm needed a Swiss account, they said that he was living in Thailand when it was opened, adding: “Can you please tell me if you would prefer to put your money in a Thai or Swiss bank?”</p> \\n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \\n<h2>Ferdinand and Imelda pillage the Philippines</h2> \\n<p>Swiss banks have cultivated their trusted reputation since as far back as 1713, when the Great Council of Geneva prohibited bankers from revealing details about the fortunes being deposited by European aristocrats. Switzerland soon became a tax haven for many of the world’s elites and its bankers nurtured a “duty of absolute silence” about their clients’ affairs.</p> \\n<p>The custom was enshrined in statute in 1934 with the introduction of Switzerland’s banking secrecy law, which criminalised the disclosure of client banking information to foreign authorities. Within decades, wealthy clients from all over the world were flocking to Swiss banks. Sometimes, that meant clients with something to hide.</p> \\n<p>One of the most notorious cases in Credit Suisse’s history involved the corrupt Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/16/the-dictators-wife-novel-freya-berry\">his wife, Imelda</a>. The couple are estimated to have siphoned as much as $10bn from the Philippines during the three terms Ferdinand was president, which ended in 1986.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bc6b38ab9ebfd5f7afa771b367dfaa7377269967\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc6b38ab9ebfd5f7afa771b367dfaa7377269967/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Marcoses\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Credit Suisse helped Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos open Swiss accounts under fake names.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Guardian</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>It has long been known that Credit Suisse was one of the first banks to help the Marcoses ravage their own country and in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/07/10bn-dollar-question-marcos-millions-nick-davies\">one infamous episode</a> even helped them open Swiss accounts under the fake names “William Saunders” and “Jane Ryan”. In 1995, a Zurich court ordered Credit Suisse and another bank to return $500m of stolen funds to the Philippines.</p> \\n<p>The leaked data contains an account that belonged to Helen Rivilla, an attorney convicted in 1992 for helping launder money on behalf of Ferdinand Marcos. Despite this, she was able to open a Swiss account in 2000, as was her husband, Antonio, who faced similar charges that were subsequently dropped.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \\n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2022/02/investigation-supporter-atom/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \\n  <div>\\n   default\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<p>It is hard to know how Credit Suisse could have missed the money-laundering case linking the couple to the corrupt Philippine leader, which was reported by the Associated Press. The couple, who could not be reached for comment, were able to hold about 8m CHF (£3.6m) with the bank before their accounts were closed in 2006.</p> \\n<p>One former Credit Suisse employee at the time alleges there was a deeply ingrained culture in Swiss banking of looking the other way when it came to problematic clients. “The bank’s compliance departments [were] masters of plausible deniability,” they told a reporter from the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, one of the coordinators of the Suisse secrets project. “Never write anything down that could expose an account that is non-compliant and never ask a question you do not want to know the answer to.”</p> \\n<p>The 2000s was also a decade in which foreign regulators and tax authorities became increasingly frustrated at their inability to penetrate the Swiss financial system. That changed in 2007, when the UBS banker Bradley Birkenfeld voluntarily approached US authorities with information about how the bank was helping thousands of wealthy Americans evade tax with secret accounts.</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \\n <blockquote> \\n  <p>We are transparent, there is nothing to hide in Switzerland.</p> \\n  <footer> \\n   <cite>Swiss Bankers Association</cite> \\n  </footer> \\n </blockquote> \\n</aside> \\n<p>Birkenfeld was viewed as a traitor in Switzerland, where banking whistleblowers are often held in contempt. However, a wide-ranging US Senate investigation later uncovered the aggressive tactics used by UBS and Credit Suisse, the latter of which was found to have sent bankers to high-end events to recruit clients, courted a potential customer with free gold, and in one case even delivered sensitive bank statements hidden in the pages of a Sports Illustrated magazine.</p> \\n<p>The revelations sent shock waves through Switzerland’s financial sector and enraged the US, which pressured Switzerland into unilaterally disclosing which of its taxpayers had secret Swiss accounts from 2014. That same year, Switzerland reluctantly signed up to the international convention on the automatic exchange of banking Information.</p> \\n<p>By adopting the so-called common reporting standard (CRS) for sharing tax data, Switzerland in effect agreed that its banks would in the future exchange information about their clients with tax authorities in foreign countries. They started doing so in 2018.</p> \\n<p>Membership of the global exchange system is often cited by Switzerland’s banking industry as a turning point. “There is no longer Swiss bank client confidentiality for clients abroad,” the Swiss Bankers Association told the Guardian. “We are transparent, there is nothing to hide in Switzerland.”</p> \\n<p>Switzerland’s almost 90-year-old banking secrecy law, however, remains in force – and was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/20/suisse-secrets-leak-financial-crime-public-interest\">recently broadened</a>. The Tax Justice Network estimates that countries around the world collectively lose $21bn (£15.4bn) each year in tax revenues because of Switzerland. Many of those countries will be poorer nations that have not signed up to the CRS data exchange.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"37ee7a9d2bf978f08263ba569b40b67e799ba28e\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37ee7a9d2bf978f08263ba569b40b67e799ba28e/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Suisse secrets graphic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Banks that enable kleptocrats to launder their money are complicit in a particularly far-reaching crime.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Guardian Design</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>More than 90 countries, most of which are in the developing world, remain in the dark when their wealthy taxpayers hide their money in Swiss accounts.</p> \\n<p>This inequity in the system was cited by the whistleblower behind the leaked data, who said the CRS system “imposes a disproportionate financial and infrastructural burden on developing nations, perpetuating their exclusion from the system in the foreseeable future”.</p> \\n<p>“This situation enables corruption and starves developing countries of much-needed tax revenue.

He is arguably rivalled only by relatives of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/05/nigeria-sani-abacha-jewellery-police\">brutal Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha</a>, who is believed to have stolen as much as $5bn from his people in just six years. It has long been known that Credit Suisse provided services to Abacha’s sons, opening Swiss accounts in which they deposited $214m.</p> \\n<p>Credit Suisse was publicly contrite after being kicked off a sustainable investment index over the affair. “We understand that the index was not really happy with us being involved with Abacha – we were not happy ourselves,” a spokesperson said in 1999. “But we have addressed those problems and for several years we have taken internal measures to make sure nothing similar happens in the future.”</p> \\n<p>Banks that enable kleptocrats to launder their money are complicit in a particularly far-reaching crime. The consequences for already impoverished populations can be devastating, as state coffers are siphoned, basic standards are eroded and trust in democracy plummets.</p> \\n<p>Politicians and state officials are among the riskiest customers for banks because of their access to public funds, particularly in developing nations with fewer legal safeguards against corruption. Banks and other financial institutions are required to subject politically exposed persons, or PEPs, to the most stringent checks, known as “enhanced due diligence”.</p> \\n<p>The leaked Credit Suisse data is peppered with politicians and their allies who have been linked to corruption before, during or after they had their accounts. None are as well known as the Marcoses or the Abachas, but several wielded great power in countries from Syria to Madagascar, where they amassed personal fortunes.</p> \\n<p>They include Pavlo Lazarenko, who served a corrupt single year as prime minister of Ukraine between 1997 and 1998 before applying for an account at Credit Suisse. One month after pressure from rivals forced Lazarenko to announce his resignation, he opened his first of two Credit Suisse accounts. One was later valued at almost 8m CHF (£3.6m).</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53d09b0a5cf33dc765b4d37e3cb46340f0148669\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53d09b0a5cf33dc765b4d37e3cb46340f0148669/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pavlo Lazarenko, former Ukrainian prime minister\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pavlo Lazarenko, former Ukrainian prime minister.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Guardian/Alamy</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Lazarenko was later <a href=\"https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/526111/files/E_CN.4_Sub.2_2004_23-EN.pdf\">estimated</a> by Transparency International to have looted $200m from the Ukrainian government, allegedly by threatening to harm businesses unless they paid him 50% of their profits. He pleaded guilty to money laundering in Switzerland in 2000, and was later indicted in the US for corruption and sentenced to nine years in prison in 2006 in relation to bribes received from a Ukrainian businessman.</p> \\n<p>His lawyer said those convictions did not relate to the theft of any money from the people of Ukraine. Lazarenko, who reportedly lives in California, has resisted returning to the country, where he still faces accusations he stole $17m. His lawyer said his Credit Suisse accounts had not been accessed for two decades and were frozen in connection with court proceedings against him.</p> \\n<p>It remains unclear why Credit Suisse allowed Lazarenko to open an account and deposit such huge sums in the first place, given his background; before entering politics, Lazarenko was a functionary in charge of a collective farm.</p> \\n<p>Monika Roth, an expert on money laundering and a professor at Lucerne University, said Swiss banks had for a long time struggled to properly challenge politicians and public officials who, after stints in public office on relatively modest salaries, turned up with huge sums to deposit. She said: “Nobody wants to have asked the question: how is that possible?”</p> \\n<p>Around the time it was doing business with Lazarenko, Credit Suisse appears to have also made inroads into the Egyptian political establishment under the dictator Hosni Mubarak, who was president for three decades until 2011. The bank’s clients included Mubarak’s sons, Alaa and Gamal, who established business empires in Egypt.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68d8145c71ef8b236e27928ccf88aba8e476e55f\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68d8145c71ef8b236e27928ccf88aba8e476e55f/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alaa and Gamal Mubarak\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alaa and Gamal Mubarak.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Guardian</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>The brothers’ relationship with the bank spanned decades, with the earliest joint account opened by the brothers in 1993.

They say the case was politically motivated, but after an unsuccessful appeal Alaa and Gamal paid an estimated $17.6m to the Egyptian government in a settlement agreement that made no admissions of guilt.</p> \\n<p>Lawyers for the brothers reject any suggestion they were corrupt, saying their rights were violated during the Egyptian case, and 10 years of wide-ranging and intrusive investigations into their global assets by foreign authorities has not uncovered any legal violations. They added that their Swiss accounts had been frozen for over a decade, pending the resolution of investigations by the Swiss authorities.</p> \\n<p>Other Credit Suisse clients linked to Hosni Mubarak were the late tycoon Hussein Salem – who acted as a financial consigliere for the dictator for nearly three decades, amassed a fortune through preferred tender deals and died in exile after facing money-laundering charges – and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/28/egyptian-billionaire-spared-death-penalty\">Hisham Talaat Moustafa</a>, a billionaire politician in Mubarak’s party.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d415e7d60024b87bc0f07d49035d6ee0548bc546\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d415e7d60024b87bc0f07d49035d6ee0548bc546/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hisham Talaat Mustafa and Hussein Salem\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hisham Talaat Mustafa (left) and Hussein Salem.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: AP/EPA</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Moustafa, who could not be reached for comment, was convicted in 2009 of hiring a hitman to murder his ex-girlfriend, the Lebanese pop star Suzanne Tamim – but his account was not closed until 2014.</p> \\n<p>Another Mubarak henchman linked to Credit Suisse’s banking services was his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/19/omar-suleiman\">former spy chief Omar Suleiman</a>.

It contained a maximum balance of 2m CHF (£900,000) and remained open until 2013, two years after he was arrested in Switzerland for suspected war crimes. He denies wrongdoing and the investigation is ongoing.</p> \\n<p>If ordinary Algerians, Egyptians and Ukrainians have reason to complain that Credit Suisse may have aided nefarious leaders, their grievances pale in comparison with Venezuelans.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76be9c8be801ef6fb9894e5544ce10490342402e\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76be9c8be801ef6fb9894e5544ce10490342402e/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Khaled Nezzar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Khaled Nezzar.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Guardian</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>Reporters working on the Suisse secrets project identified Credit Suisse accounts linked to almost two dozen business people, officials and politicians implicated in corrupt schemes in Venezuela, most of which revolved around the state oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA).</p> \\n<p>“Corruption has always been around in PDVSA, in varying degrees and levels,” said César Mata-Garcia, an academic at the University of Dundee specialising in international petroleum law. “The words ‘Venezuela’, ‘PDVSA’ and ‘oil’ are an alarm bell for banks.”</p> \\n<p>If so, that does not appear to have stopped Credit Suisse acquiring clients later revealed to be involved in numerous US investigations and prosecutions linked to PDVSA and the looting of the Venezuelan economy.</p> \\n<p>One case involves two US-based businessmen with Venezuelan connections, Roberto Rincón Fernández and Abraham Shiera Bastidas, who in 2009 set about bribing officials in exchange for lucrative PDVSA contracts with the help of an associate, Fernando Ardila Rueda. Among those who allegedly received bungs were the energy vice-minister, Nervis Villalobos Cárdenas, and a senior PDVSA official, Luis De Léon Perez.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"32ebde15478e47f15f7ac2f7717f1b79f2de7880\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32ebde15478e47f15f7ac2f7717f1b79f2de7880/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nervis Villalobos Cárdenas, Roberto Rincón Fernandez, Abraham Shiera Bastidas and Luis De Léon Perez\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: Nervis Villalobos Cárdenas, Roberto Rincón Fernández, Abraham Shiera Bastidas and Luis De Léon Perez.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Guardian</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>In 2015, US prosecutors began indicting the participants; court papers make repeated reference to payments into accounts in an unnamed Swiss bank. However, the leaked data reveals all five men had Credit Suisse accounts active at the time of the offences. Of the five, four have pleaded guilty. The exception, Villalobos, is resisting extradition to the US from Spain.</p> \\n<p>Some of the Venezuela-linked Credit Suisse accounts contained enormous sums; Villalobos had as much as 9.5m CHF (£6.3m) in his account and De Léon had as much as 22m (£15.5m). Rincón, the businessman paying their bribes, had more than 68m CHF (£44.2m) in his account as of November 2015, the month prior to his arrest.</p> \\n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \\n<h2>‘How many rogue bankers before you become a rogue bank?’</h2> \\n<p>When Credit Suisse’s ornate headquarters were constructed in the 1870s in Zurich, they were designed to symbolise “Switzerland as a financial centre”. More than 150 years later, Credit Suisse occupies the same grand premises and Switzerland remains a global offshore centre, much as it has done for the last 300 years.</p> \\n<p>It is only in recent decades that Credit Suisse, one of Switzerland’s oldest and most cherished banks, acquired its reputation for calamity. As one commentator observed earlier this week: “The bank boasts that its purpose is to serve its wealthy clients ‘with care and entrepreneurial spirit’, but at this stage most of them would probably be happy if it could just avoid yet another major scandal.”</p> \\n<p>Horta-Osório lasted less than a year before resigning last month. Shortly after Credit Suisse appointed its new chairman, Axel Lehmann, the bank reported a loss of 1.6bn CHF (£1.3bn) in the fourth quarter, in part because it had put aside more than 400m CHF (£320m) to deal with unspecified “legacy litigation matters”.</p> \\n<p>And there is no shortage of those. The scandals involving Greensill, Archegos and Mozambique bonds have dogged the bank over the past year.</p> \\n<p>Over the past three decades, Credit Suisse has faced at least a dozen penalties and sanctions for offences involving tax evasion, money laundering, the deliberate violation of US sanctions and frauds carried out against its own customers that span multiple decades and jurisdictions. In total, it has racked up more than $4.2bn<strong> </strong>in fines or settlements.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"960e6f48e521a078bdd26c2817804c6303e5b234\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/960e6f48e521a078bdd26c2817804c6303e5b234/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cash graphic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some of the accounts in the leak remain open today.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Guardian</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>That includes the $2.6bn the Swiss bank agreed to pay US authorities after pleading guilty to conspiring to aid tax evasion in 2014; the $536m it was fined by the US five years before for deliberately circumventing US sanctions against countries including Iran and Sudan in 2009, and other payouts to Germany and Italy over tax evasion allegations.</p> \\n<p>Against this backdrop, the Suisse secrets revelations may fuel questions over whether Credit Suisse’s challenges are indicative of a deep malaise at the bank.</p> \\n<p>Jeff Neiman, a Florida-based attorney who represents a number of Credit Suisse whistleblowers, believes the sheer number of scandals involving the bank indicates a deeper problem.</p> \\n<p>“The bank likes to say it’s just rogue bankers. But how many rogue bankers do you need to have before you start having a rogue bank?” he said. Neiman alleges there has been a culture at the bank “which encourages its bankers probably from the top down to hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil, bury their heads in the sand on a good day, and on many days, actively assist folks to skirt whatever the law may be in order to best protect assets under management”.”</p> \\n<p>Such allegations are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/20/credit-suisse-responds-suisse-secrets-disclosures-statement-switzerland\">strongly rejected by Credit Suisse</a>. “In line with financial reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime,” the bank said in its statement, adding that it upheld “the highest standards of conduct”.</p> \\n<p>Its lawyers said it had fully cooperated with many of the investigations cited by the Guardian and that any past individual failings by the bank did not reflect its current business policies, practices or culture. In November, it announced it would put “risk management at the very core of the bank”.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Story%20tips%3F&amp;description=Do%20you%20have%20information%20about%20this%20story%3F%20Email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Ainvestigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Einvestigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20use%20Signal%20or%20WhatsApp%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566%20or%20(US)%20%2B1%20646%20886%208761.%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Do you have information about this story?

Of the remaining accounts, which remain active, the bank said it was “comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control-related steps were taken, including pending account closures”.</p> \\n<p>The Credit Suisse statement added: “These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit the bank and the Swiss financial marketplace, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years.”</p> \\n<p>The debate over whether Switzerland’s banking industry has undergone sufficient reforms is likely to be renewed in light of the leak. The whistleblower who shared the data suggested that banks alone should not be blamed for the state of affairs, as they are “simply being good capitalists by maximising profits within the legal framework they operate in”.</p> \\n<p>“Simply put, Swiss legislators are responsible for enabling financial crimes and – by virtue of their direct democracy – the Swiss people have the power to do something about it. While I am aware that banking secrecy laws are partly responsible for the Swiss economic success story, it is my strong opinion that such a wealthy country should be able to afford a conscience.”</p> \\n<p>* <em>Currency conversions are based on historical rates.</em></p>', 'shortUrl': 'https://www.theguardian.com/p/kyz5p'}, 'isHosted': False, 'pillarId': 'pillar/news', 'pillarName': 'News'}]}}\n",
